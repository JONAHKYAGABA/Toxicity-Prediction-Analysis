# Toxicity Prediction Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis pipeline for the **Toxicity Prediction Dataset** provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to explore physicochemical features of chemical compounds and analyze their relationships with toxicity classification.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

The project performs the following key tasks:

- Loads and processes the UCI Toxicity dataset using the `ucimlrepo` library
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on features and target variable
- Computes correlations between numerical features and toxicity
- Visualizes data distribution, outliers, and feature interactions
- Prepares the dataset as a CSV for downstream tasks such as modeling

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Toxicity Prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Toxicity+Prediction)
- **ID**: `728`
- **Description**: The dataset consists of numerical molecular descriptors and a binary classification label (`Toxic`, `Non-toxic`).
